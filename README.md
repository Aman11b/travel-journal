# Travel Journal App  

## Overview  
This is my first React app, a simple **Travel Journal** application. The app displays information about various travel destinations, including images, descriptions, and links to Google Maps for each location. It uses React concepts like **JSX**, **components**, **props**, and **array mapping** to dynamically render content.

## Features  
- Displays a list of travel destinations dynamically using data stored in an array.  
- Each destination includes:  
  - An image of the location.  
  - The name of the location and country.  
  - Dates of the trip.  
  - A brief description.  
  - A link to view the location on Google Maps.  
- Clean and reusable component structure.

## Topics Learned  
While building this project, I learned the following:  
1. **React Basics**  
   - Understanding how React is different from traditional web development.  
   - Writing and using JSX.  
   - Creating custom components.  
2. **Props**  
   - Passing data to components using props.  
   - Using the spread operator (`...`) to pass all properties dynamically.  
3. **Array Mapping**  
   - Dynamically generating components from an array using the `map()` function.
